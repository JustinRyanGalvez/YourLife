# YourLife
YourLife is a fitness/nutrition app that will calculate various categories based on your fitness or nutritional goals. A mobile app will be implemented in the future. 
The repository will be an open source project that anyone, including you, can contribute to! 

**FUNCTIONALITY**

This website will do multiple things such as calculate caloric maintenance levels using the _Mifflin-St Jeor formula_, describe how much to eat based on whether the user wants to bulk, cut, or maintain their weight, calculate BMI, and more! It will also remind the user to consume the appropriate amount of water per day based on the users preference. To do this, the user will be given an option to insert their weight, height, age, gender, and the rest will be calculated on the backend. 

**HOW TO TEST**

Simply clone the repository over to your environment and open the YourLife.html file. As things get updated, the locally hosted website will be updated. It's that easy!

**HOW TO CONTRIBUTE**

 Simply create a pull request with a small description on what changes you have made and contributions listed. Your pull request will be peer reviewed and be given feedback if accepted or denied.
 
 Photos and demos will be provided once determined. 

Thank you in advance to everyone that participates in this project ! :)
